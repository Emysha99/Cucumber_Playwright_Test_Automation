## Tools and Frameworks
- **Cucumber**: Used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to write human-readable test scenarios.
- **Playwright**: A modern test automation framework for reliable, fast, and scalable UI testing.

## Project Details
- **UI Testing**: The testing was performed on [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
- **API Testing**: A provided JAR file was used for testing.

## Features
- **BDD Approach**: We wrote Gherkin scenarios for clear and understandable test cases.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organized UI test scripts for maintainability and scalability.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Used for automated test runs.
